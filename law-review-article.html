                        <p>The availability of dependable, reasonably priced, and technologically advanced telecommunications systems is essential to modern economies and international trade. In European countries, until recently, national monopolies, known as Postal Telegraph and Telecommunications Administrations ("PTT"s),<sup>1</sup> controlled telecommunications. Each country developed its own PTT, which monopolized telecommunications equipment and service provision in its respective country.<sup>2</sup> Cooperation between the PTTs was poor because of conflicting national standards, incompatible equipment types, and monopoly restrictions.<sup>3</sup> As a result, Europe suffered from poor telecommunications quality, prompting the European Community (the "EC")<sup>4</sup> to consider methods to effect change in the market.</p>

                        <p>Despite EC efforts over the last decade, international telephone calls within the EC are more expensive than intra-American calls over the same distance.<sup>5</sup> Also, international calls from Europe to the United States are more expensive than the same calls originating in the United States.<sup>6</sup> Furthermore, there are fewer telephone lines per capita in Europe than in either Japan or the United States.<sup>7</sup></p>

                        <p>European users continue to face excessive delays for installation of telephone services. In Spain, the waiting list for phone installation numbers 244,000 orders, and in Greece the list contains over one million requests, some of which will wait more than four years.<sup>8</sup> Even in Belgium, the home of the EC headquarters, residents are sometimes forced to wait for over six months to have basic service installed.<sup>9</sup></p>

                        <p>Over the last decade, most theorists have come to agree that monopolistic control of the telecommunications industry results in lower quality and higher costs.<sup>10</sup> In response, European economists and legislators have been calling for a change from the traditional, monopolistic control of telecommunications services provision to an openly competitive market.<sup>11</sup> These theorists argue that Europe must allow the market to regulate itself through open competition in order to prepare the EC for competition in the global telecommunications market.<sup>12</sup> Hoping to advance the quality of European telecommunications, and to assist the economic harmonization of the EC,<sup>13</sup> policy makers have been calling for reregulation, liberalization, deregulation, and privatization<sup>14</sup> of the European PTTs.</p>

                        <p>In 1987, the European Commission (the "Commission") drafted the Green Paper on the Development of the Common Market for Telecommunications Services and Equipment (the "Green Paper")<sup>15</sup>, which called for deregulation of much of the European telecommunications market.<sup>16</sup> The Green Paper called for the European countries to separate their national service provider from their national policy maker.<sup>17</sup> It also required open competition in both the telecommunications terminal market and the market for non-basic telecommunications services.<sup>18</sup> The EC has made significant movements towards these goals over the last seven years.<sup>19</sup></p>

                        <p>Despite its deregulatory goals, however, the Green Paper, and the directives that followed it,<sup>20</sup> endorsed continued operation of the PTTs in some aspects of the telecommunications market.<sup>21</sup> Proponents of the PTTs claimed that telecommunications should be considered a public utility, justifying the PTTs' existence as natural monopolies.<sup>22</sup> They also claimed that PTTs provided a public service and that, through monopoly control of the network infrastructure, PTTs could offer the public economies of scale that a competitive telecommunications market could not match.<sup>23</sup> Many people, however, disputed these supposed benefits and began to demand open competition in all aspects of the telecommunication market.<sup>24</sup></p>

                        <p>This Note examines the pressures that forced the PTTs toward deregulation and studies the steps that have been taken to achieve deregulation. In addition, this Note analyzes the present level of deregulation effected by several EC Member States and the prospects for further deregulation. Part I of this Note lists the many forces, both internal and external, that have made impractical continued operation of telecommunication monopolies in Europe. Part II describes the steps taken by the European Commission, the European Council of Telecommunications Ministers (the "Council"), and the European Court of Justice to deregulate telecommunications in the EC. Part III discusses the difficulties that complicated, and continue to disrupt, the deregulation process. In an effort to analyze the multinational deregulation process, Part III also surveys eight individual European nations, grouped by their level of development.<sup>25</sup> Finally, this Part examines the forces battling for and against further deregulation and hypothesizes on the future of the PTTs. This Note concludes that the EC has successfully established a trend towards deregulation, exemplified by the recent proposal for deregulation of the voice telephony market,<sup>26</sup> and will achieve deregulation of all telecommunications markets in Europe within the decade.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-20">I. THE IMPRACTICALITY OF CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE EUROPEAN PTTs AS REGULATED MONOPOLIES</h3>

                        <p>Despite the long-standing tradition of allowing PTTs to regulate and provide telecommunications in Europe, many industry experts have criticized the PTTs as inefficient and costly. In addition, several experts now contend that the PTT structure is unsuited for global competition. Detractors also point out that PTTs, which are guaranteed monopoly control over their country's market, have no incentive to standardize their systems with other European countries. What follows is an analysis of the factors that have made it difficult for monopolistic PTT operation to satisfy European users or to achieve EC telecommunications goals.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">A. Rejection of PTT Advantages</h4>

                        <p>Although PTTs claim that they are best able to provide national telecommunications services, theorists have come to reject claims that monopolistic service benefits from economies of scale.<sup>27</sup> Furthermore, these theorists now doubt that PTTs truly serve the public interest.<sup>28</sup> Drawing support from the results of American telecommunications deregulation, these theorists argue that the public would benefit from open competition.<sup>29</sup></p>

                        <p>One European analyst claimed that the installation of a greater number of telephone lines in America than in Europe is a direct result of the judicially required deregulation in America.<sup>30</sup> Similarly, the United States Federal Communications Commission concluded that " 'the rise of 1 million in the number of American households with a telephone in 1985-86 suggests that "universal service"[<sup>31</sup>] has not been affected by divestiture.' "<sup>32</sup> In addition, since the early 1980s, deregulation has reduced the cost of American long distance services by forty percent.<sup>33</sup> Based on these facts, many claim that services would similarly improve and prices would drop significantly if European telecommunications were opened to competition.<sup>34</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">B. The EC Standardization Goal</h4>

                        <p>Many policy makers believe that EC deregulation will speed movement towards the standardization of European telecommunications equipment and services..<sup>35</sup> When left unregulated, the PTTs of individual European nations have established different national standards that prevent cross-European uniformity. The PTTs wanted to retain complete control over their respective country's market, so they purposely created standards different from their neighbors, thus excluding foreign goods from their national market.<sup>36</sup> Deregulation rectifies this problem by subjecting the PTTs to EC-wide interests, such as telecommunications standardization.<sup>37</sup> Standardization works towards the "full interconnectivity" of European telecommunications systems, which is necessary to establish pan-European networks.<sup>38</sup> With unification through standardization, Europe can offer many new services and will also be better equipped to battle non-European companies that try to establish de facto world-wide standards by virtue of market dominance.<sup>39</sup></p>

                        <p>The Council enunciated the important EC goal of establishing "Community-wide network integrity... [that] work[s] on the principle of full interconnectivity"<sup>40</sup> in its directive endorsing the Green Paper. The EC has three primary goals in the development of a European telecommunications network infrastructure: the development of Community-wide "electronic highways," the establishment of pan-European mobile telecommunications systems, and the creation of a new European regulatory framework for satellite communications.<sup>41</sup> These networks are a part of the "trans-European" network infrastructure, the development and interconnection of which has been awarded "special priority" by the Council.<sup>42</sup></p>

                        <p>Two major steps are necessary to establish an international "electronic highway." First, the individual nations must enhance the capacity of their existing network, which requires the digitization<sup>43</sup> of their analog lines.<sup>44</sup> Second, these nations must standardize their networks so that, by interconnecting the national networks, they can achieve a trans-European network.<sup>45</sup> Once such a network is achieved, the EC hopes to implement Integrated Services Digital Network ("Digital Network")<sup>46</sup> technology throughout the system and, eventually, to operate its better and faster successor, Integrated Broadband Communications ("Broadband Communications").<sup>47</sup> The main objective of a key program for promoting European network coherence, Research and Development in Advanced Communications Technologies for Europe ("RACE"), is to achieve "Community-wide introduction of [Broadband Communications] by 1995, taking into account the evolving [Digital Network] and national introduction strategies."<sup>48</sup></p>

                        <p>All European countries are already working on implementing plans to adapt their national networks to Digital Network technology.<sup>49</sup> As of 1991, five Member States were already reported to have introduced commercial Digital Network systems, and five others to have launched experimental systems.<sup>50</sup> In an attempt to ensure that these developments will eventually lead to a European network, the Council has promulgated legislation to harmonize the Digital Network efforts in all European countries.<sup>51</sup></p>

                        <p>Deregulation was necessary to establish the EC's authority to control the standards created by the individual European PTTs.<sup>52</sup> Such control is necessary if the EC hopes to achieve full interconnectivity. Strategists also hope that deregulation will force nations to achieve finite deadlines for the activation of pan-European telecommunications networks.<sup>53</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">C. New Technologies</h4>

                        <p>Technological advances have complicated the PTTs' system of strict regulation. Advances have merged historically unregulated computer technology with historically regulated telecommunications technology.<sup>54</sup> For the most part, regulators have loosened control over telecommunications rather than tightened control over computer regulations.<sup>55</sup> The PTTs had owned and operated the physical infrastructure of hard-wire lines, access to which was necessary to operate telecommunications services, and the PTTs had easily prevented competition by restricting access to the infrastructure. But technological advancements allowed competitors to bypass parts of the PTTs' hard-wire system, minimizing the PTT advantage.<sup>56</sup></p>

                        <p>Cellular technology enabled the PTTs' competitors to provide tele­communications services to users without accessing the hard-wire network. By 1990, Europe had 3.4 million cellular subscribers.<sup>57</sup> As cellular technology advances, the price of service, relative to the use of monopoly operated service, will drastically decrease, which will increase the number of subscribers.<sup>58</sup> Similarly, satellite technology allows the PTTs' competitors to relay telecommunications signals over long distances without accessing the government-owned hard-wire network.<sup>59</sup> Proposals for satellite personal communications combines both satellite and cellular technology to bypass completely the PTTs.<sup>60</sup></p>

                        <p>Other technological developments will create more options that bypass the government-owned infrastructure. The biggest example of this is the advances in packet switching and optical fiber technology, which allow line networks, such as cable, to compete in the telecommunications market.<sup>61</sup> Another potential source of competition comes from a recent invention by Wavephore that allows the use of television bandwidths as informational highways.<sup>62</sup> The latest development in the United States makes it feasible for even electric lines to carry information, thereby enabling electric companies to compete in the telecommunications market.<sup>63</sup></p>

                        <p>Private services have also adapted technologies to allow users to bypass Europe's high telecommunication services rates.<sup>64</sup> The most significant such practice is commonly known as "leased lines."<sup>65</sup> Other operations such as dial-back allows operators to transmit international long-distance calls through hubs that offer less expensive rates.<sup>66</sup> In a dial-back operation, a European caller calls the dial-back operator in America but hangs up after one ring. The American operator calls the European caller back and then conferences him with the American party he wants to reach.<sup>67</sup> This allows the European callers to take advantage of lower U.S. rates, and pierces the monopoly protection around the European providers.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">D. Foreign Competition</h4>

                        <p>Free market reforms in other countries have forced Europe to defend itself against aggressive new foreign competitors.<sup>68</sup> The EC telecommunications market share is worth 80 billion ECUs, almost one quarter of the global market.<sup>69</sup> Foreign competitors are eager to tap into Europe's tremendous telecommunications market.<sup>70</sup></p>

                        <p>Many of the biggest international competitors in the European market are American companies.<sup>71</sup> The 1982 break-up of "Ma Bell" allowed AT&T to compete internationally and increased the number of other companies seeking a share of the European telecommunications market.<sup>72</sup> In April 1993, AT&T applied to Britain's Department of Trade and Industry for permission to operate a range of telecommunication services in and out of Britain.<sup>73</sup> US Sprint International and MCI, two companies created in anticipation of American deregulation, have since become major competitors with AT&T for telecommunications services in Europe.<sup>74</sup> In fact, Sprint even attempted to become one of Britain's basic telecommunication services providers.<sup>75</sup> Furthermore, the American divestiture created Regional Bell Operating Companies.<sup>76</sup> These companies have since expanded into international markets, primarily in the fields of fiber-optics, cellular technology, and cable television.<sup>77</sup></p>

                        <p>European companies would also stand to benefit if provided a similarly deregulated environment.<sup>78</sup> Many market analysts feel that Europe must deregulate to strengthen the competitive edge of European companies so that they can compete in a non-restricted trade environment.<sup>79</sup> In addition, countries that have opened their telecommunications markets to competition, such as the United States and Japan,<sup>80</sup> have placed political pressure on the EC to do the same.<sup>81</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">E. Customer and PTT Dissatisfaction</h4>

                        <p>European users, plagued by poor service, have also called for PTT deregulation. Despite the great steps taken towards deregulation since the Green Paper, European users and suppliers are still dissatisfied with the present state of the telecommunications market.<sup>82</sup> One estimate indicates that the incompatible technologies between Member States caused approximately one-fourth of all data traffic sent across Europe to fail to reach its destination.<sup>83</sup> That, and the fact that prices for telecommunications in Europe are much higher than in the United States,<sup>84</sup> has driven European users to demand further deregulation of the PTTs in the hope of obtaining better and more reasonably priced telecommunications services.<sup>85</sup></p>

                        <p>Even some PTTs are finally asking for further Europe-wide deregulation. A European Commission study determined that absent further deregulation, the EC market for telecommunications service will grow by only 3-4% a year.<sup>86</sup> Because this same report calculated that deregulation could lift growth to 6-7% - quadrupling the size of the market over the next 20 years - Spain, Denmark, Holland, and even Germany have joined British telecommunications suppliers in advocating rapid deregulation of voice telephony.<sup>87</sup></p>

                        <p>The European Commission has established itself as a primary force in the difficult job of guiding and unifying the deregulation process.<sup>88</sup> The pressures of competition from new technologies and new competitors assisted the Commission when it began its deregulation efforts seven years ago. The present call for better service lends support to the Commission's continued attempts to open all European telecommunications markets to competition.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-20">II. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S ATTEMPT TO STANDARDIZE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES AND TO FOSTER COMPETITION</h3>

                        <p>The Commission has released a significant amount of deregulatory legislation over the past seven years.<sup>89</sup> It began, in 1987, by releasing the Green Paper on Telecommunications Services and Equipment (the "Green Paper").<sup>90</sup> Based on authority established in the Green Paper, the Commission subsequently released two major directives: the Terminal Equipment Directive,<sup>91</sup> and the Telecommunications Services Directive.<sup>92</sup> In conjunction with the Commission's Telecommunications Services Directive, the European Council released a directive on the implementation of open network provisions (the "ONP Directive")<sup>93</sup> that further delineated the deregulation required of the PTTs. To explain what type of inter-company agreements violate competition laws, the Commission released the Guidelines on the Application of Competition Rules (the "Guidelines").<sup>94</sup> Both the Council and the Commission have continued to endorse further deregulation, most recently with a proposal for open competition in the voice telephony market.<sup>95</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">A. The Green Paper</h4>

                        <p>In 1987, after studying telecommunications in the EC, the Commission issued the Commission Green Paper on Telecommunications Services and Equipment.<sup>96</sup> The Green Paper represented the Commission's attempt to balance the Member States' fears of Commission intrusion into regulatory decisions, the PTTs' concerns about losing their protected civil service status, and the industry's demand for more access and fewer restrictions.<sup>97</sup> Despite its reluctance to attack the PTTs, the Green Paper was the primary instrument for subsequent deregulation.</p>

                        <p>To ensure further support from Member States, the Commission had to endorse the PTTs, but it attempted to use the Green Paper to establish the process for future deregulation. The Commission understood that it could not imitate the strict deregulation in the United States, but could only hope to accrue enough political concessions from the Member States to begin the "re-regulation" of Europe.<sup>98</sup> Because the PTIs were actually government agencies, and AT&T had only been a governmentally endorsed monopoly, the PTTs were more entrenched than AT&T had ever been.<sup>99</sup> In addition, due to the tenuous unification of the European countries, the Commission held less enforcement power over European PTTs than the United States Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") had held over AT&T.<sup>100</sup></p>

                        <p>Because they inhibit the free flow of goods, the Green Paper urged the end of monopolies in the telecommunications market.<sup>101</sup> As a major concession, however, it "accept[ed] ... continued exclusive provision or special rights for the PTfTs regarding provision and operation of the network infrastructure."<sup>102</sup> To explain its endorsement of the PTTs, the Green Paper argued that public service goals, economies of scale, and the high cost of building parallel networks justified upholding the monopolies.<sup>103</sup> In reality, this provision was intended to assure the PTTs that the development of a common policy was not at odds with their interests.<sup>104</sup></p>

                        <p>The Green Paper called for open competition in all aspects of telecommunications except for basic services, which would remain under the PTTs' monopoly control.<sup>105</sup> It admitted that "the trend towards [network] integration has ... led to a blurring of traditional boundaries between services [and that] [t]here is at present no agreed definition of 'basic services' within the Community."<sup>106</sup> The Green Paper, however, called for a narrow construction of the definition of basic services to include only voice telephony.<sup>107</sup> Though voice telephony represented 85- 90% of the PTTs' annual revenues in 1987,<sup>108</sup> basic services were expected to grow more slowly than value added services,<sup>109</sup> which were projected to grow 36% per year.<sup>110</sup> Thus, even the requirement to deregulate non-basic services was very significant. Furthermore, despite its endorsement of the PTTs' control over basic service, the Green Paper called for numerous deregulatory changes in the market.<sup>111</sup></p>

                        <p>Traditionally, the PTTs had done more than just provide telecommunications service. They had also set prices and conditions, and granted approval for the provision of service and equipment.<sup>112</sup> Even AT&T, at the height of its power, had never operated with this much control, but was always subject to FCC regulations.<sup>113</sup> The Green Paper demanded the separation of regulatory and operational activities of the European PTTs.<sup>114</sup> Further, it set as a primary goal the establishment of EC-wide common technical standards in telecommunications terminals.<sup>115</sup> Noting the incompatibility of different Member States' telecommunications equipment, the Commission created the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ("ETSI").<sup>116</sup></p>

                        <p>In addition, the Green Paper called for open competition in telecommunications markets. It sought to eliminate the tie between telecommunications service and the provision of telecommunications equipment<sup>117</sup> in an effort to achieve open competition in the terminal market.<sup>118</sup> It further decided that new services should be completely open to competition,<sup>119</sup> and proposed that even basic telephone services for calls crossing national borders should be opened to competition.<sup>120</sup></p>

                        <p>Fearing that PTTs might improperly "cross-subsidize" their new value-added services,<sup>121</sup> and thereby undercut fair competition, the Commission called for a strict accounting system subject to continuous review.<sup>122</sup> It remained unclear, however, who would provide this continuous review. It would have been problematic for the Member States to do this review, because they would have been merely policing themselves.<sup>123</sup> The Commission itself, however, did not have the manpower to review all Member State activity.<sup>124</sup> Significantly, the Commission did not prohibit the PTTs from competing in any new services,<sup>125</sup> unlike the American approach, which prohibited AT&T from competing in some markets after its break-up.<sup>126</sup></p>

                        <p>A major accomplishment of the Green Paper was the establishment of the Commission's authority to implement the deregulatory goals. Recommendation "H" stated that the Commission was to provide "strict and continuous review of operational [commercial] activities of Telecommunications Administrations according to Articles 85, 86, and 90 [of the] EEC Treaty."<sup>127</sup> Article 90 was most significant because it empowered the Commission to apply the competition laws of Articles 85 and 86 to public undertakings, such as the PTTs.<sup>128</sup> More importantly, Article 90(3) allowed the Commission to issue directives implementing these laws without prior Council approval.<sup>129</sup> Since the Council consists of representatives from the Member States, while the Commission is a more independent body, this provision effectively enabled the Commission to pass directives without Member State consent.</p>

                        <p>The Green Paper met with widespread approval. Less than a year after its initial release, the Commission published a work program on implementation of the Green Paper's recommendations.<sup>130</sup> In June 1988, the Member States, through the European Council, passed a resolution accepting the Green Paper's balance between the status quo and deregulation.<sup>131</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">B. The Terminal Equipment Directive</h4>

                        <p>The Commission moved quickly to employ its power over the PTTs, as established by the Green Paper. The Commission's first Green Paper initiative was the Terminal Equipment Directive.<sup>132</sup> This directive required PTTs to separate their regulatory bodies from their commercial distributors.<sup>133</sup> This requirement was primarily responding to the concern that such control discouraged inter- and intra-state competition. The Terminal Equipment Directive also required Member States to provide to the Commission, and to publish, a list of all technical specifications of domestically approved terminal equipment.<sup>134</sup> This ensured that producers in other Member States could compete by producing terminal equipment that met these standards. It also restricted a country's ability to refuse imports due to standards violations.</p>

                        <p>This directive required Member States to establish a system of open competition in the EC's telecommunications terminal equipment market.<sup>135</sup> It required the abolition of all special or exclusive rights previously granted to PTTs to import, sell, and lease terminal equipment, to market certain services, or to make connections to the public network and/or maintain terminal equipment.<sup>136</sup> This directive also prohibited "tying," a process whereby national monopolies would only provide service if the user agreed to purchase telecommunications equipment from the national producer.<sup>137</sup> But it did allow a PTT either to ban equipment that failed to meet the requirements of directives on harmonization of EC telecommunications equipment,<sup>138</sup> or alternatively, to have its own nondiscriminatory technical requirements.<sup>139</sup></p>

                        <p>Several European countries reacted strongly to the Commission's bold move. France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, and Greece challenged the Commission's Terminal Equipment Directive in the European Court of Justice.<sup>140</sup> The challenge did not address the substance of the directive so much as it challenged the Commission's authority to pass such a directive.<sup>141</sup> Upholding the Commission's authority to force such deregulation on the PTTs, the Court substantially upheld the validity of the directive.<sup>142</sup> Thus, the Commission was empowered to effect change in the European telecommunications establishment.</p>

                        <p>While the Green Paper and subsequent directives made great strides towards deregulation, true liberalization of the terminal equipment market required the establishment of highly technical standards with which European companies would comply. For this reason, the Council also released directives that established standards so that competing telecommunications equipment producers could achieve mutual recognition.<sup>143</sup> These standardizing directives were useless until the Commission established its authority to enforce them, in the same way that the Green Paper could not effect standardization without these directives to delineate what the European standards were.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">C. The Services Directive</h4>

                        <p>The second Commission directive to flow from the Green Paper, the Directive on Competition in the Markets for Telecommunications Services,<sup>144</sup> further advanced open competition in telecommunications.<sup>145</sup> Releasing this directive was a daring act by the Commission because it was done before the Court had even decided on the legitimacy of the Terminal Equipment Directive.<sup>146</sup> The Services Directive addressed the problem of the PTTs' being both referee and player in the telecommunications markets<sup>147</sup> by requiring a body independent of the telecommunications organization to control certain licenses, specifications, frequency allocations, and surveillance of usage conditions.<sup>148</sup> These provisions responded to the concern that PTTs suffered from inherent conflicts of interest, and challenged the long-standing tradition that gave the PTTs free reign in the telecommunications markets.</p>

                        <p>Calling for open competition in telecommunications services, this directive demanded that Member States "withdraw all special or exclusive rights for the supply of telecommunications services other than voice telephony" and allow private operators to supply such services.<sup>149</sup> Furthermore, this directive required PTTs to provide private operators the opportunity to obtain leased-lines for circuit- or packet-switched data services.<sup>150</sup> This provision was intended to allow private companies to compete in "services designed to improve telecommunications functions, .. . information services providing access to data bases, remote dataprocessing services, message storing and forwarding services, . . . transaction services, . . . [and] teleaction services."<sup>151</sup> Thus, the PTTs were forced to allow competitors to enter the market in numerous non-basic services.</p>

                        <p>The deregulatory effect of the Services Directive was limited, however. First, its coverage was limited in that it did not apply to "telex, mobile radiotelephony, paging and satellite services."<sup>152</sup> Second, it still allowed Member States to retain monopolies over voice telephony,<sup>153</sup> for which it has been criticized as being an ineffective instrument of deregulation.<sup>154</sup> This exception presumed voice telephony to represent analog transmissions, as distinguished from data transmissions, and was intended to allow only analog technology to remain under monopoly control.<sup>155</sup> Because digital technology is now used even for telephony, however, this provision allowed PTTs to retain some aspects of digital technology under monopoly control too.<sup>156</sup> "[B]y allowing the PTTs to keep control over private lines for voice and also allowing the PTTs to define the scope of that control, the Services Directive [ ] reinforced a significant barrier to the development of competition even in data."<sup>157</sup></p>

                        <p>In light of the competing interests involved in the European telecommunications market, however, many analysts have conceded that this directive might have failed had it been too aggressive. A difficult balance had to be struck between speedy liberalization and slowly building a strong foundation. "A slower pace may [have] yield[ed] a better foundation and structure for the provision of telecommunications products and services which in the long term may [have] be[en] in the best interest of the industry and its customers. On the other hand, if the pace [was] too slow, international telecommunications opportunities may [have] be[en] lost."<sup>158</sup></p>

                        <p>Once again, some Member States disapproved of this implementation of Commission power without prior Council approval. Spain, Belgium, and Italy challenged the Services Directive.<sup>159</sup> As it did in the challenge to the Terminal Equipment Directive,<sup>160</sup> the European Court of Justice substantially upheld the Commission's authority.<sup>161</sup> In a continued effort to achieve Member State support, however, the Commission agreed to pass the Services Directive on the same day the Council passed a framework directive for Open Network Provision ("ONP Directive").<sup>162</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">D. The ONP Directive</h4>

                        <p>As part of the Commission's agreement to strengthen support for the Services Directive, the Council passed the ONP Directive.<sup>163</sup> This directive established its own goals for the industry and empowered its own self-created committees to pass further directives to implement these goals. The ONP Directive was closely modeled after the American Open Network Architecture ("ONA"), which was developed by the FCC in the wake of the AT&T break-up.<sup>164</sup></p>

                        <p>In 1982, the Third Circuit disbanded the twenty-two Bell Operating Companies of AT&T, forming seven Regional Bell Operating Compaies.<sup>165</sup> This decision stifled innovation because each of these companies worked on developing its own basic telecommunications network instead of implementing the latest technologies.<sup>166</sup> The FCC therefore established the ONA in an attempt to eliminate the shortcomings of structural separation.<sup>167</sup> By creating "non-structural safeguards" based on the principle of free access, the FCC hoped to promote technological advancement while retaining open competition.<sup>168</sup> Stressing the unbundling of services to promote competition, "[the] ONA seemed to promise the ideal of a totally free market in telecommunications [in America]: a perfect market in which every service could be broken down into its constituent parts and priced according to some marginal cost principle, and in which the benefits of integration could be reconciled with total competition."<sup>169</sup></p>

                        <p>The EC followed the United States' development of the ONA with keen interest. Seeing the ONA as a tool that could work equally well in Europe, the Commission's Senior Officials Group for Telecommunications established the Groupe Analysis et Prevision (the "GAP").<sup>170</sup> The GAP studied the ONA and issued a report supporting a comparable European entity.<sup>171</sup> After multiple revisions, the GAP proposal was passed as the Council's ONP Directive on June 28, 1990.<sup>172</sup> This directive was intended to balance the Member States' concern with the Services Directive.<sup>173</sup></p>

                        <p>The ONP Directive purported to attempt "harmoniz[ation of] conditions for open and efficient access to and use of public telecommunications networks," and to facilitate sufficient access to such networks such that even the PTTs' competitors could use them freely.<sup>174</sup> Though the ONP Directive appeared to promote competition, it actually entrenched PTT control and reassured the PTTs of their place in the market. Unlike the ONA, which had not concerned itself with protecting AT&T, the GAP proposals stated that the "ONP should not lead to the gradual erosion of the current position of the Telecommunications Administrations in the overall market place."<sup>175</sup> Furthermore, the ONP Directive guaranteed the PTTs' continued control of basic service by limiting itself from interfering with "restrictions which may be derived from the exercise of special or exclusive rights granted by Member States and which are compatible with Community law."<sup>176</sup></p>

                        <p>Though the ONP Directive was only intended to stimulate development of nonreserved telecommunications services, it did attempt to promote fair competition between PTTs and private service operators.<sup>177</sup> Thus, there were some deregulatory aspects to. the ONP Directive. One major step towards deregulation was the ONP Directive's requirements that tariff principles be "clearly laid down to ensure fair and transparent conditions for all users."<sup>178</sup> Until the ONP Directive, even if the PTTs were required to provide competitors with access to the hard-wire system, they could retain their monopolistic control by imposing arbitrary tariffs on system usage.<sup>179</sup></p>

                        <p>The drafters of the ONP Directive envisioned "a kind of pan-European motorway system over which any operator ... could run telecommunication services."<sup>180</sup> To implement this vision, the ONP Directive prohibited tariffs that discriminated against competitors<sup>181</sup> whom the PTTs had been over-charging to retain their market control. The ONP Directive required that PTTs treat service providers equally by setting transparent tariffs "sufficiently unbundled" so that users knew what they were paying for.<sup>182</sup> Though the Directive expressed a desire for the tariffs to be based on objective criteria and to be "cost-oriented," it accepted that "the fixing of the actual tariff level will continue to be the province of national legislation and is not the subject of open network provision conditions."<sup>183</sup></p>

                        <p>Regarding the promotion of inter-European standardization, the ONP Directive simply stated that European standards should comply with existing international standards, such as those set by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations ("CEPT").<sup>184</sup> Further, it stated that ETSI was to develop standards for new telecommunications technologies.<sup>185</sup> The ONP Directive clearly prioritized standardization as part of its objective to promote the creation of pan-European networks.<sup>186</sup></p>

                        <p>The ONP Directive also promoted open competition by requiring the PTTs to set reasonable and transparent usage conditions.<sup>187</sup> It required that the conditions for access to services offered by telecommunications administrations in the Member States be based on objective criteria, be published, and be understandable.<sup>188</sup> This directive also required Member States to guarantee equality of access and act nondiscriminatorily within the parameters of Community law.<sup>189</sup> Further, it prohibited restricted access to public telecommunications networks and/or public services "except for reasons based on essential requirements, within the framework of Community law."<sup>190</sup></p>

                        <p>To enforce the goals it set forth, the ONP Directive contained a provision for the establishment of an "advisory" committee composed of representatives of the Member States and chaired by a representative of the Commission.<sup>191</sup> The ONP Committee's primary task was to consult with users, consumers, manufacturers, and service providers, and thus apply the ONP principles to the four key areas of the telecommunications sector:<sup>192</sup> Integrated Services Digital Network ("Digital Network"),<sup>193</sup> Packet Switched Data Services,<sup>194</sup> leased lines,<sup>195</sup> and voice telephony.<sup>196</sup></p>

                        <p>Though the ONP Directive eased the Member States' concern over the Services Directive, it may have actually strengthened the Commission's control over telecommunications by entangling it in a process of Europewide regulation.<sup>197</sup> Using the established legislation, the Commission and Council have recently released numerous deregulatory proposals under the auspices of the ONP Directive in such areas as Packet Switched Data,<sup>198</sup> leased lines,<sup>199</sup> and Digital Network.<sup>200</sup> Significantly, the Council has proposed application of the ONP Directive to voice telephony,<sup>201</sup> which would signify the end of the PTTs' guaranteed market control. The EC's most recent proposal has been for an ONP Directive on mobile (cellular) services.<sup>202</sup></p>

                        <p>Another complication arose from the European interest in standardization.<sup>224</sup> When attempting to standardize telecommunications, it is easier to deal with only one provider from each nation than to attempt agreement between multiple operators from each country. This is one reason that the Commission endorsed continued PTT operation in all but its most recent legislative efforts.<sup>225</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">E. The Guidelines</h4>

                        <p>The Commission understood that the interests of "full interconnectivity" through standardization often require PTTs to enter agreements that conflict with the requirements of open competition. In an attempt to clarify which agreements between PTTs are acceptable under EC competition rules and which type of agreements are prohibited, the Commission released Guidelines for the PTTs.<sup>203</sup> Though these Guidelines did not create enforceable rights, they were based on an analysis of European Court holdings and did indicate how the European Court of Justice (the "ECJ") would enforce competition laws in the telecommunications sector.<sup>204</sup> The Guidelines attempted to balance the EC goal of promoting competition between PTTs with the reality that sometimes technological advances and further standardization require agreements between PTTs.</p>

                        <p>In some ways, the Guidelines reinforced the PTTs' control by tacitly accepting the notion that only PTTs provide telecommunications facilities. The Guidelines themselves claimed to "govern the way [PTTs] can provide those facilities to the service providers" which "must" access them.<sup>205</sup> This represented "a bias towards the status quo and a failure to recognize the full opportunity for competition in the telecommunications industry."<sup>206</sup> But the Guidelines did achieve some measure of deregulation. They listed the types of agreements which will be subject to scrutiny to help companies avoid violating antitrust laws.<sup>207</sup> Thus, the Guidelines clearly established that some types of anti-competitive activity are considered "undesirable collusion,"<sup>208</sup> and, as such, are subject to disciplinary action.<sup>209</sup></p>
                        <p>The Commission has entrenched itself in the European telecommunications markets as the primary regulator of the PTTs. Beginning with the Green Paper, and continuing through subsequent directives, the Commission has forced tremendous reforms on the monopoly operators. The Council has assisted the deregulatory process by supporting Commission efforts and by passing its own legislation to govern the PTTs, most significantly, the ONP Directive.<sup>210</sup> Bolstered by ECJ endorsement and Council reinforcement, the Commission has successfully opened many telecommunications markets to competition and it will continue to do the same in other telecommunications markets.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-20">III. HURDLES IN THE ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THE DEREGULATORY GOALS OF THE GREEN PAPER</h3>

                        <p>The Commission faced numerous hurdles in enforcing the Green Paper's deregulating goals. European countries did not want the EC Commission to control their economic decisions.<sup>211</sup> Therefore, some countries challenged Commission directives even when they approved of the directives' goals.<sup>212</sup> Though the ECJ substantially upheld the Commission's legislative authority, these challenges, which represented a lack of support for the Commission, slowed the deregulatory process.<sup>213</sup></p>

                        <p>In addition, many countries disapproved of the theories behind the deregulating efforts. The more technologically advanced countries had already provided basic service to their residents and wished to further develop their value-added services. Some of these advanced countries believed that enhanced services could best be developed by strong government involvement. The most extreme example of this attitude existed in France, where the government pioneered the Minitel to provide a twoway text-link in three million homes.<sup>214</sup></p>

                        <p>Most of the developed countries, however, agreed that open competition was the best way to achieve greater enhanced services. But many lesser developed countries, which were more concerned with supplying basic service to their residents, believed that a national monopoly would best accomplish this goal. These countries feared that if they allowed open competition, most companies would focus their energies on the more profitable enterprise of enhancing service on the existing hard-wire lines. By neglecting the less profitable laying of more wires, these companies would be leaving some residents with no service at all.<sup>215</sup></p>

                        <p>Other complications restricted the Commission's efforts. Europe was replete with unknown telecommunications needs among Member States and evolving international and national laws and policies.<sup>216</sup> In addition, the absence of a single authority meant that the regulatory process was highly susceptible to Europe's volatile political climate.<sup>217</sup></p>

                        <p>The delayed progress of the Maastricht Treaty<sup>218</sup> and the limited application of the Uruguay round of the GATT talks<sup>219</sup> have exposed a lack of European unity. Furthermore, the multiplicity of agreements that continually redefine the balance of power, such as the International Telecommunications Union,<sup>220</sup> the International Consultative Committees, the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee,<sup>221</sup> and the International Radio Consultative Committee, have made market definition and competitive positions difficult to predict or to quantify.<sup>222</sup> In addition, explosive developments in telecommunication technology sometimes wreak havoc with traditional notions of telecommunications and monopoly-based services.<sup>223</sup></p>

                        <p>The enormous power held by the PTTs was another reason the Commission was forced to endorse PTT control.<sup>226</sup> The governments of the Member States were reluctant to forgo the profits obtained through control of a telecommunications monopoly.<sup>227</sup> Presumably, their sub-contractors also favored the status quo out of a fear that any industry changes would cost them work. Even labor groups favored PTT operation because telecommunications workers were loath to relinquish the benefits of being civil servants.<sup>228</sup> Finally, European anti-monopoly efforts have been complicated by the reality that individual nations have reacted differently to deregulating legislation.<sup>229</sup></p>

                        <p>Despite all of these complications, the Commission has been substantially successful in enforcing its directives and in integrating market deregulation. According to the latest Commission Report, only Belgium and Spain have failed to apply the Terminal Equipment Directive properly, and only Greece has yet to satisfactorily implement the Services Directive.<sup>230</sup> In addition, only Greece and Italy have not succeeded in adopting the policies espoused in the ONP Directive.<sup>231</sup></p>

                        <p>To appreciate truly the deregulation progress, it is necessary to analyze the changes that have been implemented in individual European nations. This analysis examines the PTTs in individual European countries, grouped by their level of economic development. This Note discusses each country's separation of telecommunications regulatory control from its national service provider. Also discussed are national movements toward open competition in the telecommunication terminals market, and similar movements toward open competition in the telecommunications services market.<sup>232</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">A. The Most Developed Countries</h4>

                        <h5 class="mb-20">1. The United Kingdom</h5>

                        <p>The United Kingdom ("UK") serves as the model for European telecommunications deregulation. The deregulation process began in 1984, when the Thatcher Government passed the Telecommunications Act,<sup>233</sup> which privatized British Telecommunications ("BT"), the UK's PTT,<sup>234</sup> and established the government's intent to "dissolve" BT's monopoly.<sup>235</sup> The government then created a duopoly in the telecommunications market and, from 1984 to 1990, allowed Mercury Communications to compete with BT.<sup>236</sup></p>

                        <p>In 1990, a six-month review of the duopoly market culminated in a white paper that called for free and unfettered competition in all facets of telecommunications.<sup>237</sup> Since that time, the government's Department of Trade & Industry, acting in collaboration with an independent regulatory body known as OFTEL, has regulated the market and endorsed open competition in all British telecommunications markets.<sup>238</sup> In subsequent licensing decisions, the UK established a trend towards relatively unrestricted competition between the network and private providers.<sup>239</sup> Without additional primary legislation, the UK succeeded in substantially subjecting telecommunications to open competition.<sup>240</sup></p>

                        <p>The UK's deregulation is evident in all of its telecommunications markets. Provision of leased lines has grown from three networks to over 700 lines, provided by nearly 120 firms.<sup>241</sup> The government has licensed private providers of mobile radio, paging, cable television, and value-added network services.<sup>242</sup> The UK has also endorsed open competition in the terminal equipment market. Though the 1984 Act required terminal equipment providers to obtain operation licenses to ensure compliance with technical standards, it clearly encouraged competition.<sup>243</sup> Since that time, the licensing process has been well-organized, and it has even been legal to sell unlicensed, non-standard equipment.<sup>244</sup></p>

                        <p>Despite these advances, some analysts point out the difficulties that result from such an unregulated environment, such as the need for increased government supervision.<sup>245</sup> In addition, some still claim that, despite appearances, the UK is not truly deregulated.<sup>246</sup> One recent report claimed that a long distance call from the UK to the United States costs five times as much as it should.<sup>247</sup> Most legislators, however, are satisfied with the level of telecommunications technology in the UK and envision such achievements across Europe.<sup>248</sup></p>

                        <p>In contrast, despite one analyst's claim that Ireland has one of Europe's most modem telecommunications systems,<sup>249</sup> Ireland has been granted an extended deadline for telecommunications deregulation. Telecom Eireann is a State-owned company that controls Irish telecommunications and is subject to intense governmental control.<sup>250</sup> In an attempt to optimize the network potential, Telecom Eireann is considering an alliance with the British telecommunications provider, Cable and Wireless. Such an alliance would eventually lead towards privatization and deregulation.</p>

                        <h5 class="mb-20">2. France</h5>

                        <p>France exemplifies the technologically advanced country that desires high quality telecommunications but believes that government regulation is a valid means to attain that goal. Recently, however, France has effected some deregulation to comply with Commission directive. French telecommunications laws are governed by the Code des Postes et Télécommunications (the "Code"), which integrates legislative and regulatory acts relating to the market.<sup>251</sup> In May 1989, French law separated the telecommunication regulation authority from the entrepreneurial body of its PTT, France Télécom.<sup>252</sup> Since that time, the Code has incorporated many deregulatory laws in the telecommunications market to comply with EC requirements.<sup>253</sup></p>

                        <p>France Télécom has two principal areas of responsibility: network and services provision, and entrepreneurial activities (e.g., providing customer premises equipment and advanced services).<sup>254</sup> France has moved quickly to open competition in its terminals market. At the same time, it has also attempted to regulate the standards of the manufactured terminals by introducing the Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive<sup>255</sup> into national law, even before the November 1992 deadline.<sup>256</sup> Therefore, though the French Code allows open competition in the terminal equipment supply market,<sup>257</sup> there are strict approval requirements before competitors can use, sell, or connect their terminals to the network.<sup>258</sup></p>

                        <p>France Télécom retains a strong monopoly in many areas, and has made only minimal allowances of open competition to comply with EC directives. For example, France Télécom holds a monopoly over the public switched network, though the Minister of Telecommunications may grant a license to other users when it does not interfere with the PTT's monopoly.<sup>259</sup> In addition, both telephone and telex services can only be provided by France Télécom.<sup>260</sup> The enhanced service provision market is an exception to France's strict regulation of its telecommunications markets. Though such providers must be licensed by the Telecommunications Minister, such licenses are given freely, and that market has been fully open to competition since January 1993.<sup>261</sup></p>

                        <p>In 1991, public law privatized France Télécom.<sup>262</sup> But despite some signs of liberalization,<sup>263</sup> France has tried to deregulate as little as it can under EC law.<sup>264</sup> One author, discussing the recent French Privatization Program, noted that "[u]nlike Thatcher's move, the French plan will leave untouched the country's- state-run ... telecommunications services, considered among the most advanced in Europe."<sup>265</sup></p>

                        <p>In contrast with the UK's leaps toward competition, France improved its once primitive telecommunications system by intense government involvement.<sup>266</sup> The French PTT also created telecommunications terminals, called Minitels, available at little or no cost, and has played an active role in administering the network.<sup>267</sup> Therefore, developments in France constitute a strong argument against the claim that open competition is necessary to develop advanced technology.<sup>268</sup></p>

                        <p>Some critics have pointed out that France's intense governmental involvement has weakened its position in some telecommunications markets.<sup>269</sup> Critics of the French methodology claim that state control has resulted in the development of fewer services, which will result in less business in the long run.<sup>270</sup> In sum, although substantially complying with EC directives to avoid retribution for violations, France has deregulated as little as possible.<sup>271</sup></p>

                        <h5 class="mb-20">3. Germany</h5>

                        <p>Germany was a long-time traditionalist, relying on government-owned monopoly providers for telecommunications services. <sup>272</sup> Until 1988, telecommunications was a government responsibility.<sup>273</sup> The Deutsche Bundespost, which was headed by the Federal Minister of Posts and Telecommunications ("MPT"), acted as Germany's PTT and was not subject to any regulatory body.<sup>274</sup> Beginning in 1985, however, the German government established a commission of politicians, academics, and others (including labor, producer, and consumer representatives)<sup>275</sup> to "develop[ ] proposals for the reform of the telecommunications sector."<sup>276</sup></p>

                        <p>Finally, in 1989, German legislators passed the Postal Constitution Act (the "Act"), which required structural and regulatory changes in the telecommunications market.<sup>277</sup> The Act separated regulatory responsibility from the Deutche Bundespost and gave it to the MPT.<sup>278</sup> It also separated telecommunication from postal operation, and vested telecommunications enterprises in DBP Telekom.<sup>279</sup></p>

                        <p>The Act has completely opened terminal equipment to competition.<sup>280</sup> Providers need now only show that the new equipment will not harm any person or DBP Telekom's transmission lines.<sup>281</sup> In addition, the equipment is subject to type-approval by the Federal Office for Telecommunications Approvals to ensure compliance with standardization requirements.<sup>282</sup></p>

                        <p>Despite the new law, DBP Telekom still holds some monopolies in telecommunications services, such as a limited network monopoly (restricting the right to set up and operate telecommunications transmission lines and their associated networks)<sup>283</sup> and a radio monopoly.<sup>284</sup> While the Act also permits DBP Telekom to continue its monopoly over the provision of voice telephony, the Act opens all other services to competition without requiring governmental licensing.<sup>285</sup></p>

                        <p>Though the Act has advanced deregulatory efforts, some users complain that German telecommunications laws fail to clearly establish what activities are permitted, complicating the operation of private providers who do not wish to violate any laws.<sup>286</sup> Furthermore, DBP Telekom has yet to be privatized, and remains a public administration.<sup>287</sup> Many forces within Germany are pushing towards privatization<sup>288</sup> and the German Parliament is finally introducing the necessary constitutional amendments to privatize the German PTT,<sup>289</sup> but the move has been delayed by political debate.<sup>290</sup> In addition, some say that delays in Germany's movements towards deregulation are justified due to Germany's preoccupation with modernizing telecommunications provision in East Germany.<sup>291</sup></p>

                        <h5 class="mb-20">4. Italy</h5>

                        <p>Italy is the least developed of the countries in this category and is also disadvantaged by its unusual system of telecommunications provision. The Ministry for Post and Telecommunications has remained responsible for national telecommunications, controlling the State Agency for Telephone Services ("ASST"), a public body that provides some basic services. <sup>292</sup> The ASST, in turn, licenses out the rights to provide the remaining services to three other companies: SIP, ITALCABLE, and TELESPAZIO.<sup>293</sup> In reality, however, the state owns all of these companies through public financial entities.<sup>294</sup></p>

                        <p>Despite minor legislative changes in 1984,<sup>295</sup> the still-in-force 1973 Postal and Telecommunications Code<sup>296</sup> subjected all telecommunications markets to control by a public monopoly. Recently, however, the Italian Parliament began to implement legislation to reform the Italian telecommunications system.<sup>297</sup> As envisioned in the 1992 law, Italy soon hopes to bring all the telecommunications licensees together to form a single company, provisionally named Telecom Italia.<sup>298</sup></p>

                        <p>Italy has substantially succeeded in opening its terminal equipment market to competition. But this seems to be the only area in which Italy has complied with EC policy.<sup>299</sup> Italy has largely failed to open telecommunications services to competition. Basic, and even enhanced, services are still controlled by a state monopoly. Only newly developed services, classified as value-added services, are fully liberalized.<sup>300</sup> To comply with EC pressure, Italy is currently trying to open some telecommunications markets to competition.<sup>301</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">B. Lesser Developed Countries That Were Granted an Extended Deregulation Deadline <sup>302</sup></h4>

                        <h5 class="mb-20">1. Spain</h5>

                        <p>ITT and the Spanish government created the Spanish PTT, Telefonica De Espana ("Telefonica"), in 1924.<sup>303</sup> Though legally a private company, 32.28% of Telefonica's shares are still held by the government.<sup>304</sup> The legislation policing the telecommunications market was very disorganized until the Spanish Parliament passed the Telecommunications Act (the "Act") in 1987.<sup>305</sup> But the Act did little to deregulate the market.</p>

                        <p>The Act did separate the regulatory functions of the government from the operations of the monopoly provider,<sup>306</sup> but Spain has been slow to open its equipment market to competition. Only in 1991 did a law allowing free sale of a basic telephone come into effect.<sup>307</sup> Furthermore, the Commission has expressed concern about the monopolization of terminal equipment provision.<sup>308</sup></p>

                        <p>For the most part, the Act and subsequent legislation have yet to open services to competition.<sup>309</sup> The Act created classifications for different services. It required basic services, such as basic telephony, telex, and telegraph to be provided by Telefonica on a monopoly basis.<sup>310</sup> One class of services, carrier services, was originally retained by the monopoly provider, but was to be fully liberalized by January 1993.<sup>311</sup> The Act did open most value-added services to competition, requiring entrants only to comply with standardization and authorization requirements.<sup>312</sup> But the Act reserved even some value-added services for monopoly control.<sup>313</sup> Spain needs time to first organize control over its market, but it should soon be prepared to work towards open competition.</p>

                        <p>Similarly, the Portuguese government is especially reluctant to remove its monopolistic control over telecommunications provision because, as of 1990, of all EC countries, it has the least number of telecommunications lines per inhabitant.<sup>314</sup> Thus the government fears that open competition will leave many inhabitants with no service at all.<sup>315</sup> The Portuguese PTT ("CTT") was a public company under the political authority of the Ministry.<sup>316</sup> CTT provided almost all postal services and telecommunications services. Only two other carriers were able to obtain government concessions to provide services. The first was Telefones de Lisboa e Porto, a public company which provided telephony in Lisbon and Oporto. The second was Companhia Portugesa Radio Marconi, which provided intercontinental telephone and telex services, international telegraphy (apart from Spain), and intercontinental links for new services such as the data network. These two companies share a board of directors, whose members are nominated by the government. Portugal plans a consolidation of its separate operators, similar to Italy's plan.<sup>317</sup></p>

                        <h5 class="mb-20">2. Greece</h5>

                        <p>Greece has been the slowest EC country to develop its telecommunications markets.<sup>318</sup> Greece is disadvantaged due to infrastructural, organizational, and political problems.<sup>319</sup> Nevertheless, Greece has attempted to implement laws to increase telecommunications competition.<sup>320</sup></p>

                        <p>Until recently, Greek telecommunications were controlled by the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA, which was publicly owned, but financially autonomous, as required by statute.<sup>321</sup> Greece's first step towards deregulation was a 1990 law that granted private entities the right to compete in mobile and value-added services markets.<sup>322</sup> In addition, on July 31, 1992, Greece enacted a law calling for a separation between the telecommunications regulator and the telecommunications provider.<sup>323</sup> It also called for partial privatization of the Greek PTT.<sup>324</sup> Recently, a political shift slowed Greek deregulation,<sup>325</sup> but much of the PTT is already privately owned.<sup>326</sup> Due to Greece's particular problems, it probably will not achieve open competition in its telecommunications markets in the near future, but may be able to break its telecommunications monopoly into a private oligopoly.<sup>327</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">C. The Current State of Telecommunications and Prospects for the Future</h4>

                        <p>It is difficult to quantify the present level of telecommunications deregulation in the EC. In some ways, much deregulation remains to be implemented before European telecommunications are truly open to competition.<sup>328</sup> State owned monopolies still control the majority of EC telephone services,<sup>329</sup> and each EC Member State (except for Britain) still offers "exclusive rights" to a single telecommunications company.<sup>330</sup> But much has been opened to competition and there are strong movements for even more deregulatory legislation.</p>

                        <p>Most market analysts believe that the balance within Europe is tipping in favor of liberalization, especially considering the latest proposals for full liberalization of all voice telephony in the EC, to be phased in over a number of years.<sup>331</sup> In a recent display of optimism, telecommunications ministers from all European nations agreed that most EC countries should end monopolies over telephone calls by 1998, giving Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain until 2003.<sup>332</sup> In addition, most European countries have attempted to create open competition in the cellular phone market, despite the fact that they could legally allow monopoly control.333 Furthermore, the Commission has established its intention to fully liberalize satellite communications in the near future.<sup>334</sup></p>

                        <p>Though most analysts now agree that the monopolistic control by PTTs does not benefit telecommunications users,<sup>335</sup> some countries still oppose open competition. Belgacom, Belgium's PTT, and France Télécom (described by a Brussels insider as "a bank that happens to run telecoms services"<sup>336</sup>) are the staunchest opponents to deregulation. Even the Competition Commissioner, Belgian Socialist Karl van Miert, is less enamored with the free market than his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan.<sup>337</sup> Furthermore, Jacques Delors, the Commission's president, was hesitant to implement any controversial EC measure before Germany, Denmark, and Britain ratified the Maastricht Treaty.<sup>338</sup> This was pointed to as an indication that he is unlikely to endorse any radical legislation against Member States' wishes.</p>

                        <p>Critics of deregulation point out that open competition may result in short-term dangers to consumers.<sup>339</sup> For example, while monopolies over voice telephony are still allowed, the PTTs might increase the price of basic service to compensate for loss of revenues in other markets.<sup>340</sup> In addition, the quality of the networks that PTTs still operate might drop due to restricted budgets resulting from losses in competitive markets.<sup>341</sup> Others have criticized the EC's deregulation attempts, claiming that "EC policy [is] unclear," and that it has impeded the efforts of European companies attempting to achieve global competitiveness.<sup>342</sup> But most analysts have accepted the reality that deregulation is coming, though it will still take a lot of work.<sup>343</sup></p>

                        <h3 class="mb-20">CONCLUSION</h3>

                        <p>Over the last six years, the Commission has made strong advances towards the deregulation of European telecommunications, most importantly by establishing its authority over the Member States' PTTs. In light of the recent proposal to deregulate even voice telephony,<sup>344</sup> it seems that the PTTs are destined to disintegrate. Enough businessmen and politicians now understand the need for open competition in telecommunications that even if the voice telephony proposal is rejected, complete deregulation is still inevitable.</p>

                        <p>The road ahead, however, remains long and complicated. Though some countries have approached their goal of full deregulation, others are more entrenched in their traditional, monopolistic, telecommunications organizations. Despite these difficulties, recent developments have indicated that all European telecommunications markets will be deregulated within the decade.</p>

                                The next step, liberalization, is the encouragement of the private sector to compete with
                                the monopolist provider. Eventually this leads to deregulation, which aims to remove all governmental control, leaving the open market as the only regulator. Though the term deregulation is used most often, it is a misnomer since true deregulation has not even been achieved in the United Stated or the United Kingdom and will probably never be achieved. See Constantelou, supra note 8, at 433. Though many market analysts believe that the movement towards "deregulation" enhances telecommunications quality, there are some who criticize such a view for its unrealistic simplicity.

                                Privatization represents a shift of the PTT's management from government control to private ownership. This is usually done to raise capital or to increase operating efficiency and technology. See id. at 433-34. Although privatization does represent a loosening of the monopoly held by the PTT, it does not, in itself, induce competition. See The New Boys, supra note 2. To effectively open the markets to competition, the national governments must also endorse anti-monopoly legislation.

                            <li>This distinction is important when analyzing telecommunications development and deregulation. The more developed, "northern," countries have national policies that consider competition and liberalization in the telecommunications market as tools for improved industrial performance. In contrast, national policy in the lesser developed, "southern," countries is more conservative in light of moderate domestic industrial performance and national economies based on the activities of small and medium-sized companies.

                            <li>"Recent technological progress and the experience of the United States suggest that the 'natural' justification for upholding monopoly provision of telecommunications, even in basic voice telephone service, is suspect." Naftel, supra note 2, at 462. As a result, when examining fair competition cases, some critics in the EC have questioned whether "natural monopoly" is a proper justification for anti-competitive practices.

                            <li>The term "universal service" has long been used as an argument against open competition in telecommunications.

                                [m]et for the first time with a group of international investors in its $3.37 billion
                                Iridium project. The project is a global telecommunications network that
                                utilizes wireless telephones and 66 low-earth-orbit satellites. The initial investors include representatives from... Europe .... Together, they have signed
                                non-binding letters of intent to invest an initial $800 million in the project.
                                Launching of the Iridium satellites is scheduled to begin in 1996, with commer- cial service anticipated in 1998.</li>

                            <li>Originally, cable networks posed no threat to the PTTs because available technology did not allow such a line network to provide telephone services. But advances in optic fiber and packet switching technology now make it possible for a line network to upgrade and provide such telecommunications services. See Morris, supra note 43, at 72- 72 n.21; Report: Towards the Information Superhighway, 1993 Telecommunications Policy 631 (describing advances in fibre-optics).</li>
                            <li>Though initial plans are limited to transmission from the television stations to their contractors, this could become more widespread. This technology transmits data nearly 40 times faster than standard telephone modems, and a subsidiary of the German electronics conglomerate, Siemens AG, moved immediately to buy exclusive rights to market it in Europe.

                            <li>"Leased lines" refers to an arrangement whereby a PTT leases an end-to-end telephone wire connection to a user, usually a business with two major locations that wants to network its entire operation. Due to the potential for "cream skimming," the PTTs established restrictive conditions under which they would lease such lines. See Morris, supra note 43, at 103 & n. 102. But recent directives have forced the PTTs to offer leased lines at non-discriminatory rates. See Council Directive 92/44 of 5 June 1992 on the Application of Open Network Provision to Leased Lines, 1992 O.J. (L 165). This most recent such directive was essential for many new entrants who could not provide their own fixed networks.</li>

See id.; see also Court Rules in Three Telecoms Cases, Reuter Eur. Report, Oct. 27, 1993, available in LEXIS, News Library, CURNWS File. The European Court of Justice, however, did overturn Article 7 of the directive, which attempted to require Member States to ensure that their PTTs give customers the opportunity to terminate leasing or maintenance contracts in order to enable consumers to obtain supplies or services elsewhere. The European Court of Justice overturned this portion of the directive because it failed to specify its reference to contracts between monopoly suppliers and end-users, despite the fact that contracts with non-monopolistic suppliers are beyond the reaches of the Commission.

Id Note that "[plromoting competition while protect- ing society is the long standing charge of telecommunications regulation." See Beaton, supra note 38, at 697. This ideal was discussed in the 1986 landmark Carterfone case before the United States Federal Communications Commission where AT&T unsuccessfully argued that allowing nonAT&T terminal equipment to interconnect with the network would harm the integrity of the network. Although it is generally conceded that AT&T's posi- tion in that particular case was untenable, the issues of who, where, and how the network is accessed still raises significant concerns in terms of national security and network integrity.

In the first stage, the State ran the PTTs, and all decisions were made by government ministers. Increasingly, countries granted their PTT corporate status and gave it operational independence. During this second stage, the state served as a major, or complete, shareholder, and government ministers still appointed the board members. Finally, in the third stage, some countries fully privatized their PTTs and removed all government involvement.<br /> Within two years, according to one estimate, only Austria, Norway, Luxembourg, and Switzerland will remain at the first stage of the development process. Those countries at the second stage include, or will soon include, Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland, and Sweden, the first four of which will soon move towards the third stage-complete privatization. The other European countries have already reached the third stage by fully privatizing their PTTs. See Adonis, supra note 228.</li>

                            <li>In 1991, the French company, Alcatel, sought to acquire control over its competitor in the terminal equipment market, the Italian company, Telettra. Both of these companies competed in Spain's terminal equipment market and, combined, they held 80% of the market. The Commission was concerned that this merger would end competition in the Spanish terminal equipment market. Though Telefonica did not object to the merger, other suppliers did, and claimed that Telefonica was biased because it held shares in both companies. These shares, they claimed, protected Telefonica and created a barrier to market entry. The EC eventually allowed the merger when Telefonica sold its shares in the two companies, and agreed to make diverse purchases, thus ensuring competitors a place in the market. See Wayne D.

In Spain, VAS are defined as services, other than broadcasting, which use basic or enhanced services but add other facilities such as data processing, access, storage, or retrieval, to satisfy additional telecommunications requirements.
